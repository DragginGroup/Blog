      <p>you know how you wanna make something, but your brain doesn't let you do it? or that you dont know how to do it?</p>
      <p>that has been the process for this blog, since day 1</p>
      <br>
      <h1 id="ComingBack" class="Chapter">Coming Back</h1>
      <p>I haven't messed with HTML... CSS... or Javascript in fuckin months dude.</p>
      <p>Coming back to it is like doing something for years and now someone is telling you that you can't.</p>
      <p>We started with "DRAGGINGBLOG" and "the blog for all things Dragging related!"</p>
      <p>And now we are at a stylized page, v0.2.3, cool custom theme, uh, blogs, ok yeah I dont know what else to mention</p>
      <br>
      <h1 id="Plans" class="Chapter">Plans</h1>
      <p>So, uh, blog is still pretty new so yesh, We got plans for it.</p>
      <p>A more descriptive Help Page would be nice, Maybe user settings (can't wait to lose my mind over that!), Bigger Team, Actually Good Web Developers, etc</p>
      <p>these would all honestly be good features wouldn't you agree?</p>
      <h1 id="Ending" class="Chapter">Ending</h1>
      <p>Sorry for leaving you so soon but there isnt much to talk about except boring crap about me searching the internet for solutions to problems im having or for how to do something like user settings</p>
      <p>But anyway, it's time to go, goodbye!</p>
