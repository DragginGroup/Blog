# DraggingBlog Modding API (v0.2.6)
## Explanation
The 0.2.6 DraggingBlog Modding API is a robust
system of image and text content replacement.

Using Modding Script Packets,
you are allowed to create simple mods to the DraggingBlog site.
Unfortunately through forks unless 
we add a system of an official mod list.

# Setup
Setting up the Mod is simple as making a folder,
and having an image or some text to replace using script packets and if replacing an image, 
have an image.

So basically, create a folder in the mod folder inside the Content folder.

Make sure it's with the mod name that you will set inside the ``mod-api.js`` script packet!
